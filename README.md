# Self-destillation_P1

Self destillation is a technique which works together with Deep Learning. It is an addition where unlabelled data is fed
back into the training loop after predicting the label with the pre-trained model.

This project is meant to find out if self destillation is beneficial in the context of predicting protein ligand
interactions when using Random Forests and Deep Learning techniques, specifically Graph Neural Networks.

This project is the result of the university course "Praktikum 1" of master studies of Computer Science 
(https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=053021&semester=2023S).
